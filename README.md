# Healthcare_Analysis_Dashboard (Interactive Dashboard Creation using Excel)
## Project Objective 
The goal of this project is to create an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze healthcare data effectively. The project aims to identify patterns in patient demographics, medical conditions, billing trends, and hospital performance to provide actionable insights for healthcare decision-makers.

## Dataset used 
- <a href="https://github.com/thecodingraj/Healthcare_Data_Analytics/commit/01b8e1d4c7a909ffff90d99390d92fd8a8857148">Dataset</a>

## Questions(KPIs)
- What is the distribution of patients by age and gender?
- What are the most common blood groups among patients?
- How do hospital admissions vary across years and months?
- What are the billing patterns by admission type (Elective, Emergency, Urgent)?
- How does the distribution of medical conditions vary by age group?
- What is the average billing amount by Admission Type?
- What is the distribution of test results across patients?
- What is the average billing amount by insurance providers?
- Which hospitals contribute the most to billing revenue?
- Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://github.com/thecodingraj/EV-Sales-Analysis/commit/686ff79669ae900a009d9a685bf99b8ef69f025a">View Dashboard</a>

## Process
- Cleaned and preprocessed the raw dataset to remove inconsistencies and missing values.
- Segmented data by demographics, medical conditions, and billing trends.
- Utilized various charts (bar, pie, line) to represent insights effectively.
- Implemented slicers for interactive filtering by demographics, years, and medical conditions.
- Explored admission trends, billing statistics, and test result distributions.
- Highlighted the top-performing hospitals and the most common patient conditions.

- Smith PLC leads as the top hospital, contributing over 1.1M in billing.
- UnitedHealthcare and Medicare are key insurance providers.

 
## Final Conclusion:
This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of healthcare operations, highlighting key patterns in patient demographics, billing, and hospital performance. The insights can help stakeholders prioritize improvements, optimize resource allocation, and enhance patient care.
